# Username/Password Authentication

Implementing username/password authentication and role-based authorization in a Rails application involves several steps. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. User Model and Authentication Setup:
   - Create a User model to store user information, including attributes like `username`, `email`, and `password_digest`.
   - Use the `bcrypt` gem to securely hash and store user passwords in the database.
   - Implement user registration and login functionality, including sign-up, login, and logout actions in the controller.

2. Sessions Controller and User Authentication:
   - Generate a Sessions controller to handle user login and logout actions.
   - Implement the login action to authenticate the user by comparing the hashed password stored in the database with the provided password.
   - Use session or token-based authentication to maintain user sessions across requests.

3. Role-based Authorization:
   - Add a `role` attribute to the User model to represent user roles (e.g., 'admin', 'moderator', 'user', etc.).
   - Implement an authorization mechanism that checks a user's role to determine whether they have access to certain resources or actions.
   - Use a gem like `CanCanCan` or `Pundit` to handle role-based authorization, defining abilities or policies for each role.

4. Application Controller:
   - In the ApplicationController, define a method to check the user's role and authorize their actions based on the defined rules.
   - For example, if using `CanCanCan`, you could use the `load_and_authorize_resource` method to automatically authorize resources based on the user's role.

5. Views and Navigation:
   - Update the views to display appropriate content and options based on the user's role.
   - Hide or show certain elements based on the user's authorization level.

6. Testing:
   - Write tests to ensure that authentication and authorization are working as expected.
   - Cover scenarios for different roles and unauthorized access attempts.

By following these steps, you can successfully implement username/password authentication and role-based authorization in your Rails application, securing various parts of your app and controlling access based on user roles.
